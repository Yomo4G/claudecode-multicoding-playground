# MCP Usage Policy

This document defines the policy for using MCP (Model Context Protocol)
integrations within this project.

MCP integrations may involve external services, credentials,
organization-specific environments, or contractual constraints.
For these reasons, MCP usage is treated as a **security-sensitive concern**
and is explicitly governed by human decisions.

## Core Principles

- MCP configuration and credentials are **not project artifacts**.
- MCP usage must never be assumed.
- Human intent and explicit configuration are required
  before any MCP integration is used.

## Human Responsibilities

The following responsibilities belong to humans:

- Creating and managing MCP configuration files
  (e.g. `mcp.json` or equivalent)
- Managing API tokens, secrets, and authentication credentials
- Ensuring compliance with organizational policies and contracts
- Deciding which MCP integrations are allowed for this project

MCP configuration files and credentials must be created
**manually by humans** and must not be generated by Claude Code.

## Claude Code Restrictions

Claude Code must adhere to the following restrictions:

- Claude Code must not generate, modify, or store MCP configuration files.
- Claude Code must not request, accept, or handle API tokens,
  secrets, or authentication credentials of any kind.
- Claude Code must not assume that any MCP integration is available
  unless it has been explicitly configured by a human.

If an MCP integration is not clearly configured,
Claude Code must treat it as **unavailable**.

## Usage During Execution

During execution, Claude Code may:

- Propose the use of an MCP integration
  if it could improve efficiency or capability
- Explain why an MCP integration might be useful

However, Claude Code must:

- Stay within the MCP usage policy defined here
- Respect any explicit allowlists or restrictions defined by humans
- Pause and ask for confirmation before relying on an MCP integration

Claude Code must never enable or configure MCP integrations on its own.

## Relationship to Project Framing

Other rule files may be generated during Project Framing,
depending on the needs and decisions of the project.

Decisions about whether MCP integrations are allowed,
and under what conditions, must be made during **Project Framing**.

This policy serves as the authoritative reference
for MCP-related decisions throughout execution.

## Rationale

These rules exist to:

- Protect security boundaries
- Prevent accidental credential exposure
- Ensure clear responsibility and accountability
- Avoid assumptions about environment-specific capabilities

When in doubt, safety and explicit human control
take precedence over automation.
